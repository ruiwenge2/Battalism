    <h1>How To Play</h1>
    <h3>Use WASD or your arrow keys to move.</h3>
    <h3>Click to use your weapon. Each time you use your weapon, you'll have less chances to use it.</h3>
    <h3>When you shoot someone with an arrow or stab someone with a sword, they will lose their health. Once a player has 0 health or less, they're out.</h3>
    <h3>You can also collect gold to get more chances to use your weapon. The number shown on the gold is their value. Once you collect them, their value is added to the number of chances to use your weapon.</h3>
    <h2>Have fun!</h2>
